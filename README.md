##### Regarding theme
A reminder for myself regarding the end product  
I am going Mario, as in Super Mario, the famous plumber and lifetime Nintendo Hero  
Which means the spaceship becomes a top down view on our moustached hero  
the space background becomes a cartoony grass underground 
the enemies become koopa troopa  
the doesn't fire but instead throws carrots it has just picked up (or jumps)
